Plays "Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe"

## Rules:

1. The game is composed of a 9-square board with a subgame in each square.
2. Winning a subgame results in a win in that square.
3. You may only move in the subgame in the square in which your opponent's
last move took place. For example, if your opponent played in the subgame
in the subgame at 2, 2, and moved in the square at 0, 0, you must now make
a move in the subgame at 0, 0.
4. A subgame tie results in the square counting as *both* X and O.
